# WIP

## Intro
This is a simple script that will cycle through RGB spectrum on some(or all) Phillips Hue lights on a network and attached corsair components compatible with ICUE.

This should allow for a big RGB setup in a room where hue lights and corsair components are present.

## Dependencies
Uses [phue](https://github.com/studioimaginaire/phue)  
Uses [ICUE SDK](https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk-python)  
Both available through "pip install {phue/cuesdk}"

## Troubleshooting
If first time running, add "b.connect()" to script. Then press the hue bridge button and within 30 seconds, run the script

## Notes
ICUE referes to  the Corsair Utility Engine [ICUE](https://www.corsair.com/icue)  
ICUE is a trademark of Corsair Components, Inc.
